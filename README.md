# War

Requirements:

1. Two players (for the time being), need a player class.

2. Before the game deck is shuffled (shuffle method).

3. Each player gets a half of the deck (probably as an instance variable a dict or a list).

4. Implement CLI UI (optional)

5. After the turn add cards to the bottom of the deck to the winners pile and shuffle won cards if more than 1.

5. Implement pauses between the turn's (an action that a player has to take here could be a solution)

6. Add game mechanics functionality (compare two cards, if equal add another pair of cards to compare, etc.)

7. Conclude the game (for e.g. print out how many turns the game took, celebrate the winner)
