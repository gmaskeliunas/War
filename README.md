2. Each player has a deck (probably as an instance variable a dict or a list).

3. Before the game each player's deck is shuffled (shuffle method).

4. Implement CLI UI (optional)

5. Implement pauses between the turn's (an action that a player has to take here could be a solution)

6. Add game mechanics functionality (compare two cards, if equal add another pair of cards to compare, etc.)

7. Conclude the game (for e.g. print out how many turns the game took, celebrate the winner)
